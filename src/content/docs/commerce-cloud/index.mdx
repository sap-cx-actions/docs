To automate the build and deployment process of SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (CCv2) projects, we have created two GitHub Actions: [SAP Commerce Cloud - Build](/docs/commerce-cloud/build) and [SAP Commerce Cloud - Deploy](/docs/commerce-cloud/deploy). These actions provide functionalities to perform build and deployment operations on SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (CCv2) projects maintained in the GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

- SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (CCv2) project with the required configurations.
- GitHub repository with SAP Commerce Cloud code as per the CCv2 project structure. (Refer to the [Commerce Cloud Sample Setup](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-commerce-sample-setup) for more details.)
- GitHub Actions enabled in the repository.
- Webhook URL (Slack or Microsoft Teams) to send notifications.
- GitHub token with the required permissions.
- SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (CCv2) API Token.
- SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (CCv2) Subscription Code.
