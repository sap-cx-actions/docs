These GitHub Actions includes the following functionalities to send notifications when a build or deployment is triggered or completed in SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (CCv2) projects.

## Webhooks

### Microsoft Teams <Icon name="microsoftTeams" label="Microsoft Teams"  color="#6264A7"/>

To send notifications to Microsoft Teams, you need to configure the webhook URL in the GitHub repository secrets. Define the environment variable in the workflow file to use the webhook URL.

```yaml {2}
env:
  WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```
And also while using build or deploy action, you can pass the _notify_ input parameter as _true_ to send notifications to Microsoft Teams.

```yaml {7}
- name: Test Action
  id: build-action
  uses: sap-cx-actions/commerce-build@v1
  with:
    branch: release/v1.0.0
    buildName: Release v1.0.0
    notify: true
```
